<h2>Website 1 Critique - Trader Joe's</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/home"></a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this site was an intrigued one because the letters on the front of a picture of meatballs read: “can meatballs be meatless?”</li>
	<li>The information on this site was organized in a horizontal layout with a picture in the center, text in the center, navigation in the left, a place to sign up in a pop-up right corner, and a search bar and the name of the website at the top.</li>
	<li>The structure of the site made a little bit of sense to me because I could see where everything was placed in case I wanted to buy a product, but I didn’t feel compelled to pay attention to the main advertisement they had placed in front of me.</li>
	<li>The graphics on this site detracted from it because I didn’t know if it was a blog page or a meal recipe site if it wasn’t for the logo at the top.</li>
	<li>The home page to a short time to load, which was reasonable for a popular store</li>
	<li>The site had a navigation bar to the left displayed with three vertical lines. The navigation was well done because it laid out the main categories and subcategories in columns separated by lines and had visual graphics to better understand what they were. For example, the products had a banana graphic next to them.</li>
	<li>The site overall had the red color prominently displayed with a vintage feel to the graphic art.</li>
	<li>When I visited the site on my phone, it showed all the main categories in the navigation but also had an additional category that wasn’t shown on my laptop. Overall, it was just as easy to navigate on the phone as the computer.</li>
	<li>One unusual thing about this site was the fact that it had a podcast section.</li>
	<li>The site has a good responsive design to smaller window sizes.</li>
	<li>This site offers entire recipes to make with their products which is unusual for food stores.</li>

<h2>Website 2 Critique - endoftheworld2012.net</h2>
<h4><a href="http://www.endoftheworld2012.net/"></h4>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this site is underwhelmed because it has an archaic design</li>
	<li>This site organizes information by putting three boxes with search titles in the center of the page</li>
	<li>This site confuses me because on top-left of the first box, there's the text "Related Searches", and a top banner that asks a question that a newcomer wouldn't understand unless they clicked on it."</li>
	<li>The site graphics detract from the webpage because there are a bunch of empty design boxes to the side of the search titled center boxes.</li>
	<li>The home page to a short time to load, which was reasonable for a popular store</li>
	<li>The text color and size were readable, as both the top banner and centered boxes were light colors for the black letters to lay on. The size was also big enough to be readable, and the background color enhanced the site since it was a dark navy color.</li>
	<li>The site had a navigation tool, which suprisingly was the banner. In my opinion the navigation wasn't well done because it did not say where to click to get to the sign in page</li>
	<li>The site did not have a look and feel that was repeated on all the pages because the storefront consisted of a plain white backdrop with black letters.</li>
	<li>The site responds well to smaller window sizes</li>
	<li>This site offers a sign in page to continue shopping, which is unusual because its focus is to provide links to some specific searches</li>

<h2>Website 3 Critique - Pitchfork</h2>
<h4><a href="https://pitchfork.com/"></h4>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this site is astounded because I didn't expect it to have such a professional looking, and interactive design.</li>
	<li>The site organizes the flow of information by creating a scheme of different news sections, that incorporate the text into clickable links.</li>
	<li>The site structure makes sense because it lists out all the sections at the top page in a banner under the websites name</li>
	<li>The site multimedia enhances the site because I see GIFS and pictures that showcase the title's context.</li>
	<li>The home page to a short time to load, which was reasonable for a popular store</li>
	<li>The text color and size were readable enough. The black background color enhanced the site because it gave a professional and sleek feel, in combination with the black words and white background on the rest of the website</li>
	<li>The site had a navigation bar, which was well done because it was found inside a three bar icon</li>
	<li>The site had a color scheme that repeated on all the pages.
	<li>The site has a responsive design, however it doesn't show one of the page sections.</li>
	<li>The site offers a section of videos, that follow a certain theme, which was well done.</li>
